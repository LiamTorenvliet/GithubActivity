There once was a child in a park, he was stumbling around in the dark. 
He heard a loud noise, and there, stood with poise,
Was a brightly dressed tapdancing shark.

The child shuddered and smiled,
He walked towards the shark and struck a pose
Right in front of his face.
The shark smiled and said,
“I’m here tonight to spread fear,
So you better watch your step,
Or the loudmouth Broadway star
Will sweep you off your feet to the great tunes,
The voice sang. (Haoming)
